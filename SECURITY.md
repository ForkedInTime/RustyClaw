## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in RustyClaw, please report it responsibly.

**Do NOT open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, please email the maintainers or use [GitHub's private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/ForkedInTime/RustyClaw/security/advisories/new).

### What to Include

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment** — within 48 hours
- **Assessment** — within 1 week
- **Fix or mitigation** — as soon as practical, depending on severity

## Security Considerations

RustyClaw executes shell commands and modifies files as part of its core functionality. Users should be aware of:

- **API keys** — stored in `.env` files. Never commit these to version control.
- **Tool execution** — the AI agent can run Bash commands. Use sandboxing (`bwrap`, `firejail`, `strict`) for untrusted workloads.
- **MCP plugins** — third-party plugins execute with the same permissions as RustyClaw.
- **SDK / Headless mode** — the NDJSON server accepts commands on stdin. Secure the transport layer in production deployments.

## Sandboxing

RustyClaw supports multiple sandbox backends to limit tool execution:

```
bwrap      — bubblewrap, lightweight Linux sandboxing
firejail   — security sandbox with predefined profiles
strict     — most restrictive, minimal filesystem access
```
