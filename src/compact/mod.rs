///
///  1. snipCompact (client-side, instant)
///     When input_tokens approaches the context limit, strip the content out
///     of old ToolResult blocks in the message history.  The tool call
///     structure is preserved so Claude still knows what tools were used,
///     but the potentially-large result payloads are replaced with a short
///     placeholder.  No API call required.
///
///  2. summarizeCompact (API-based, async)
///     Sends the full conversation to Claude with a summarisation prompt
///     and returns a replacement history containing just one user message
///     with the generated summary.  This is the "full compact" operation
///     available via `/compact` or triggered automatically when auto-compact
///     is enabled and the snip threshold has already been crossed.
///
/// Token thresholds (mirroring apiMicrocompact.ts DEFAULT_* values):
///   160 000  →  warn user that context is getting full
///   170 000  →  auto-snip (if auto_compact_enabled)
///   180 000  →  auto-summarise (if auto_compact_enabled)

Your task is to create a detailed summary of the conversation so far, paying \
close attention to the user's explicit requests and your previous actions. \
This summary should be thorough in capturing technical details, code patterns, \
and architectural decisions that would be essential for continuing development \
work without losing context.

Your summary should include the following sections:

1. Primary Request and Intent: Capture all of the user's explicit requests and intents in detail
2. Key Technical Concepts: List all important technical concepts, technologies, and frameworks discussed.
3. Files and Code Sections: Enumerate specific files and code sections examined, modified, or created. \
Pay special attention to the most recent messages and include full code snippets where applicable \
and include a summary of why this file read or edit is important.
4. Errors and fixes: List all errors that you ran into, and how you fixed them. Pay special \
attention to specific user feedback that you received, especially if the user told you to do \
something differently.
5. Problem Solving: Document problems solved and any ongoing troubleshooting efforts.
6. All user messages: List ALL user messages that are not tool results. These are critical for \
understanding the users' feedback and changing intent.
7. Pending Tasks: Outline any pending tasks that you have explicitly been asked to work on.
8. Current Work: Describe in detail precisely what was being worked on immediately before this \
summary request, paying special attention to the most recent messages from both user and assistant. \
Include file names and code snippets where applicable.
9. Optional Next Step: List the next step that you will take that is related to the most recent \
work you were doing. IMPORTANT: ensure that this step is DIRECTLY in line with the user's most \
recent explicit requests, and the task you were working on immediately before this summary request. \
If your last task was concluded, then only list next steps if they are explicitly in line with the \
users request.

Please provide your summary based on the conversation so far, following this structure and \
ensuring precision and thoroughness in your response.

Here is the conversation to summarize:
